   Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)
  
   This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.
  
  
  
     1. Definitions
  
        The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license. "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.
  
     2. Grant of Rights
  
        (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
  
        (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.
  
     3. Conditions and Limitations
  
        (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
  
        (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.
  
        (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.
  
        (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.
  
        (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

	  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
	

	



	

	  1. Definitions.
	

	



	

	     "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
	

	     and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
	

	



	

	     "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
	

	     the copyright owner that is granting the License.
	

	



	

	     "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
	

	     other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
	

	     control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
	

	     "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
	

	     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
	

	     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
	

	     outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
	

	



	

	     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
	

	     exercising permissions granted by this License.
	

	



	

	     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
	

	     including but not limited to software source code, documentation
	

	     source, and configuration files.
	

	



	

	     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
	

	     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	

	     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	

	     and conversions to other media types.
	

	



	

	     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	

	     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	

	     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	

	     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	

	



	

	     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	

	     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	

	     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	

	     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	

	     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	

	     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	

	     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	

	



	

	     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	

	     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
	

	     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
	

	     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
	

	     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
	

	     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	

	     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	

	     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	

	     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	

	     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	

	     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
	

	     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	

	     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
	

	



	

	     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	

	     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	

	     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	

	



	

	  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	

	     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	

	     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	

	     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	

	     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	

	     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	

	



	

	  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	

	     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	

	     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	

	     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	

	     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	

	     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	

	     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	

	     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	

	     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	

	     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	

	     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	

	     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	

	     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	

	     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	

	     as of the date such litigation is filed.
	

	



	

	  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	

	     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	

	     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	

	     meet the following conditions:
	

	



	

	     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	

	         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	

	



	

	     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	

	         stating that You changed the files; and
	

	



	

	     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	

	         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	

	         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	

	         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	

	         the Derivative Works; and
	

	



	

	     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	

	         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	

	         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	

	         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	

	         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	

	         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	

	         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	

	         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	

	         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	

	         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	

	         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	

	         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	

	         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	

	         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	

	         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	

	         as modifying the License.
	

	



	

	     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	

	     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	

	     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	

	     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	

	     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	

	     the conditions stated in this License.
	

	



	

	  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	

	     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	

	     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	

	     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	

	     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	

	     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	

	     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	

	



	

	  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	

	     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	

	     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	

	     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	

	



	

	  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	

	     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	

	     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	

	     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	

	     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	

	     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	

	     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	

	     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	

	     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	

	



	

	  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	

	     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	

	     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	

	     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	

	     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	

	     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	

	     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	

	     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	

	     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	

	     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	

	     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	

	



	

	  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	

	     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
